# Deep-Learning
MNIST handwriting Neural Network

The MNIST handwriting dataset is pulled from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist online.


# Running Programs
After initializing tensorflow:
To initialize the 5 layer Eager API code: python tensorflow_quick.py

To initialize the 3 layer tensorboard code: python tensorboard_output.py
To see the data created by tensorboard use: tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow_logs
Then open a browser, and go to the address listed, typically 0.0.0.0:6006
